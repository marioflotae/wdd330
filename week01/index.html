           <strong>Master Mobile UX Tutorial</strong>
           <ol>
                <li>Rewire your brain: the most people nowadays use a mobile device to navigate the web, 
                    it's better to design first for a mobile device.
                </li>
               <li>Improve UX by understanding users: Immediate, an application 
                   must always be there, meaning, available for the user when they needed 
                   (mobile device); Relevant, an application must be useful to its users, 
                   containing relevant information; Frictionless, is not only about fast loading, 
                   is about minimizing steps in a process.
                </li>
               <li>Strategic menu design: make things better for everyone. Primary controls; 
                   placement matters; understanding matters.
                </li>
               <li>4.	Forms, intuitive and mobile friendly: only requiring relevant information, 
                   simple and pretty.
                </li>
               <li>5.	Design a better mobile advertising user experience: No pop-ups; 
                   end users won't visit a website to watch ads; simple and sleek; content first
                </li>
