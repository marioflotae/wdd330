        <h3>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <h4>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h4>
        <p>
            Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually 
            caused by one of the following: 
            <ol>
                <li>System Error.- A problem with the system or with a external device</li>
                <li>Programmer Error.- Syntax error, typo, faulty logic</li>
                <li>User Error.- End user has entered wrong data.</li>
            </ol>
            An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by 
            the program to deal with the error.<br><br>
            is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. 
            It's often not just a single function or method call that causes an error. A stack trace 
            will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original 
            function or method that started the sequence.<br><br>
            A warning can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program 
            to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>Feature Detection and Debuggin in the Browser</h4>
        <p>
            The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. 
            This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying 
            to actually call the method. <br>
            Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. 
            In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated, so 
            you'll need to run through the program to see what's happening at different stages of its execution.<br>
            The <em>console.log()</em> can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program, 
            although it will not actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert() does. <br>
            Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code 
            that will pause it at certain points. You can then see the values of all the variables at those 
            points and modify them. This can be very useful when trying to track down bugs.
        </p>

        <h4>Error Objects</h4>
        <p>
            An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be 
            created in the code using a constructor function. All error objects have a number of properties, 
            but they're often used inconsistently across browsers.<br>
            It's possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement. This will allow for any 
            problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background. 
            The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop.
        </p>
       
        <hr>

        <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
        <p>
            When an exception occurs, the program terminates with an error message. It is possible to handle 
            exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified. 
            We can then deal with the error appropriately ― perhaps even ignore it ― and keep the program running. 
            Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. 
            Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur. 
        </p>
