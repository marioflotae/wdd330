        <h3>Chapter 9: The Window Object.</h3>
        <p>
            <ul class="ul-notes">
                <li>Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it.</li>
                <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
                <li>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used.</li>
                <li>The Document Object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
                <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user's computer. Cookies can be used to storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.</li>
                <li>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.</li>
                <li>The window.setInterval() method will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs.</h4>
        <p>
            <ul class="ul-notes">
                <li>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed.</li>
                <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.</li>
                <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</li>
                <li>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript. </li>
                <li>The terms shim and polyfill are often used interchangeably. The main difference between them is that a shim is a piece of code that adds some missing functionality to a browser, although the implementation method may differ slightly from the standard API.</li>
            </ul>
