        <h3>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Functions have built-in properties such as <em>length</em>, but can have custom properties added.</li>
                <li>All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this 
                    bound to an object that is provided as an argument.</li>
                <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in parentheses 
                    and immediately followed by double parentheses so they're invoked. They are useful for namespacing 
                    variables and setting default values.</li>
                <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain conditions.<br>
                    A callback is a function that's provided as an argument to another function.</li>
                <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>
                <li>A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next 
                    value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Ajax</h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>
                <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
                <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.</li>
                <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
                <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
                <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
            </ul>
